<h1> About Shawn </h1>

<div class="mainBox">

<p>
	Shawn is currently a senior in Computer Science at Tennessee Tech University, with only 9 hours of mandatory classes left! But he unfortunately cannot graduate until Spring 2015.
	This leaves him with plenty of time to pursue other interests rather than academics. 
</p>

<p>
	Aside from his job animating videos at the campus STEM Center, Shawn maintains a variety of hobbies, including:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>Drawing & Painting</li>
	<li>Running (poorly)</li>
	<li>Making movies</li>
	<li>Reading</li>
	<li>Android and Web Development</li>
	<li>Reading about Android and Web Development</li>
	<li>Clever contrasting of list items</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Shawn loves to travel. He has ventured to 26 US states, and 4 foreign countries (excluding various Carribean islands of which he literally has no idea).  Ultimately though, Shawn loves Tennessee too much to want to live anywhere else.
</p>

<p>
	If Shawn could be any household appliance, he would be a toaster oven.  Only Shawn knows his reasoning behind this choice.
