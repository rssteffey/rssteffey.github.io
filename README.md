===================

Personal site of Shawn Steffey

This is intended to be a site to showcase/store my work in Programming, Painting, and Video Graphics.
Since I'll certainly have other uses for the site, I'm combining the video category with misc. since
I will likely be referring to it the least.

I have no idea how long this is going to take to get to a point where I'm happy with the layout.
HTML is not my strong suit, but I have enough knowledge of the basics to have a go at it and enough misplaced optimism and stubbornness to refuse prebuilt templates.
I'm also taking this as an opportunity to teach myself Javascript, so.. there's that.

If anything important crops up, I'll reference it in this Readme I suppose
