===================

Personal site of Shawn Steffey, viewable at http://www.rssteffey.com

This is intended to be a site to showcase/store my work in Programming, Design, and Blogging attempts.

I have too much nostalgia with this old design and silly Javascript, so I'm leaving it.  The Sketchy Bits blog will be updated routinely to stay presentable, but the actual homepage is staying.

If anything important crops up, I'll reference it in this Readme I suppose
