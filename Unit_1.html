<h3> This may take a moment to load. It's a large file </h3>

<p> Once the video is locally hosted on the final site it should stream without this delay. For this demo I'm having to stream from my Dropbox folder </p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "http://youtu.be/GSlnEPYVfyw",
		  tracks: [{
                    file:'chapters.vtt',
                    kind:'chapters'
                }]
    });
</script>
<p>Just click on the chapter markers to go to them.  You may need Firefox or Chrome to see the video (but I may be wrong about that) </p>


<br/>
<p> If you're having issues with actually being able to watch the whole video through that player, you can download it</p>
<a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3066508/Chess/Unit1_All_Chapters.mp4"> Here.</a>
<p> But keep in mind that it will not have the associated chapters in the video file itself</p>
