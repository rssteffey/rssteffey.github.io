<div id="myElement">Loading the player ...</div>
<h3> This may take a moment to load. It's a large file </h3>

<p> Once the video is locally hosted on the final site it should stream without this delay. For this demo I'm having to stream from my Dropbox folder </p>

<script type="text/javascript">
    jwplayer("myElement").setup({
        file: "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3066508/Chess/Unit1_All_Chapters.mp4",
		  tracks: [{
                    file:'chapters.vtt',
                    kind:'chapters'
                }]
    });
</script>

<p> If you're having issues with actually being able to watch the whole video through that player, you can download it</p>
