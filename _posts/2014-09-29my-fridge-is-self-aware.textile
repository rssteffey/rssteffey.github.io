Programming knowledge is a wondrous thing.

I can make a pile of wires and silicon read my commands, translate them to a series of 1's and 0's, and then perform any action I desire (assuming I also have the hardware to support it).

It's a bit like being a wizard really.  Only rather than barely obscured latin roots combined in various ways, I just type a bunch of repetitive terms in the right pattern until something happens (also occasionally grabbing chunks of these patterns from other spells I can find on the internet).

I have the technical ability to write programs capable of absolutely ground-breaking things.  We live in era so massively interconnected, that through a little bit of code and combining the right frameworks, anything is possible.
As such, I spent the weekend making my fridge tweet things.

I have no clue why the idea came into being.  All I know is that last Saturday, I suddenly decided to build a TwitterBot.
