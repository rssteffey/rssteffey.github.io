**Shawn Watches Twin peaks**
*A review, done by Haiku*
*One per episode*

<hr>
Empty Netflix Queue
I need a new show to watch
Some cult show: Twin Peaks

**1.**
Striking scenery
Soap opera and campy
Terrible Music

**2.**
The pilot was strange
I reluctantly hit next
Giving it a chance

**3.**
Things are getting odd
I dislike David Lynch stuff
Still hate that music

**4.**
Half through the season
Only four episodes left
May as well finish

**5.**
It's starting to drag
The music never changes
Just the four same themes

**6.**
I have no idea
what is even happening
in this freaking show

**7.**
Still no answers -- but
Stockholm Syndrome has set in
I love this music

**8.**
Wait. What?.... I... that... can't...
Not the closure I hoped for
Time for Season Two
