_A review, done by Haiku_
_One per episode_
<hr>

p=. Empty Netflix Queue
I need a new show to watch
Some cult show: Twin Peaks

p=. *1.*
Striking scenery
Soap opera and campy
Terrible Music

p=. *2.*
The pilot was strange
I reluctantly hit next
Giving it a chance

p=. *3.*
Things are getting odd
I dislike David Lynch stuff
Still hate that music

p=. *4.*
Half through the season
Only four episodes left
May as well finish

p=. *5.*
It's starting to drag
The music never changes
Just the four same themes

p=. *6.*
I have no idea
what is even happening
in this freaking show

p=. *7.*
Still no answers -- but
Stockholm Syndrome has set in
I love this music

p=. *8.*
Wait. What?.... I... that... can't...
Not the closure I hoped for
Time for Season Two
