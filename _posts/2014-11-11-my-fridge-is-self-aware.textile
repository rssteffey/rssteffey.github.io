Programming knowledge is a wondrous thing.

I can make a pile of wires and silicon read my commands, translate them to a series of 1's and 0's, and then perform any action I desire (assuming I also have the hardware to support it).

It's a bit like being a wizard really.  Only rather than barely obscured latin roots combined in various ways, I just type a bunch of repetitive terms in the right pattern until something happens (also occasionally grabbing chunks of these patterns from other spells I can find on the internet).

I have the technical ability to write programs capable of absolutely ground-breaking things.  We live in era so massively interconnected, that through a little bit of code and combining the right frameworks, anything is possible.
As such, I spent the weekend making my fridge tweet things.

I have no clue why the idea came into being.  All I know is that last month, I suddenly decided to build a TwitterBot.

The plan: A webcam, some magnetic letters, and a Python OCR library.

I went to Walmart, bought a pack of alphabet fridge magnets, and set up my whiteboard.

The script only took a couple of hours to get down.  Most of the time was spent getting used to using OpenCV and understanding just how in the heck to use Twitter authorization tokens (Fun fact: I am still only 80% sure I could explain it to someone).




<code>
imgray = cv2.cvtColor(img,cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(imgray,(15,15),0)
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(blur,255,cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)
</code>



As it turns out, 640x480 resolution from across the kitchen with yellow letters in yellowish lighting is rough.

Regardless:  the revolution hasn't happened yet, so for now I feel safe.
