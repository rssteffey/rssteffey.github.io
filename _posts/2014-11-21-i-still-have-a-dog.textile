I'm afraid I made a mistake in a prior post.  I wrote an entire page about adopting Echo, but I kept referring to him as a dog.

It has been brought to my attention since this posting, that Echo is - in fact - a rare form of mountain goat.

This revelation shouldn't have come as a surprise, as the warning signs have been steadily progressing as he's grown comfortable in my house..

We've been told he may also be at least a tiny bit Gazelle, which makes sense given his propensity to leap over literally anything between him and his ball.

And he is 100% wallowing puddle of purposeful ignorance and subsequent guilt:

But in the end,  he's still the best.
Goofy he may be, but I keep pausing while typing this post just to look over at him sleeping soundly in his camp chair in the corner of my room.

I can't help but be appreciative of the happiness he brings me.

The amount of loyalty and support he brings.

The way his tai-  
...hold that thought.
