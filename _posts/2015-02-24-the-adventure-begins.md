The rain pattered on the thatch roof of the Dusty Dwarf. The barkeep stared at the rafters overhead, praying the recently applied patches would stay watertight through the night. He could do with a bit of luck. Lately the gods had not seemed pleased with him... what with all the miserable weather and guards' questioning about missing adventurers and the sort.

As far as taverns go, the Dwarf wasn't all that unclean. The ale was palatable and the beds only a bit scratchy. The sort of place passers through the small mercantile town would choose simply to avoid the outside conditions. That was the one spot of blessing that came out of that wretched rain... Charles couldn't stand the rain, but he had to admit he liked the extra business. The warm room before him now was filled with conversations across the rough wooden tables and steins of ale. Charles noticed a hooded figure in the corner, and began to daydream about questing far away from this place.

Suddenly a shadow overtook his entire view. Charles leaned back from his slouch and looked up at the figure now looming above: A giant, nearly 7 foot tall Orc.

Well, mostly Orc. The greyish purple face looked softer and less gnarled than he would have supposed, and the thick brown hair seemed far more human than Orc... but still, Charles was far more interested in self preservation at the moment than genealogy, and decided to stick with the basics.

"May I help you?", he asked more timidly than intended

The creature stared with an unchanging expression, trying to decide on the proper accent to use to sound most like a threatening 7-foot-tall Orc.

"Um... er... we..." the creature said in a gravelly tone, sounding far more like Christian Bale's Batman than he would have liked.
"I mean, we-" he tried again, this time in a gutteral growl.
"Well how about-" he managed to say in a high pitched voice before an elderly bearded figure stepped in front.

"Okay Hofskarr, never mind, I'll handle this," the new character interjected, "I have higher charisma anyway."

Charles looked back down at eye level with the man. The white beard was his most distinctive feature, aside from the large droopy purple hat. If Charles had to guess, he would definitely say this man was a wizard.
Actually he would probably say it was a sorcerer. Charles had no idea what the differences between a wizard and sorcerer were, but this man definitely seemed to be the latter.

"Excuse me my good sir, I am DALLAS. Do you happen to have any information on missing adventurers?"

Charles rolled his eyes. Day after day, a new team of adventurers came in- only to inevitably ask about missing adventurers, leave, and never return. And every time, Charles simply told the group about the previous group from before. It was a vicious cycle really. He dreamed of the day that a team of adventurers would finally return to his tavern with news of a safe journey... but until then:
"Yeah. I saw 'em. Passed through 'ere a couple weeks back. Headed down the Old Road out towards the ruins"

The bearded man seemed delighted at the news. "Thank you, m'kind sir! We wish you an impeccable day!"
Charles watched as the man turned and scuttled towards a group of three other individuals. The widest among them was clearly a dwarf, a species built with all the stature and wit of a boulder. Next to the dwarf stood a man barely 4 feet tall.
"Clearly a halfling," Charles thought to himself.
The halfling himself was too engrossed in staring at the much taller female elf standing beside him to pay attention to the sorcerer's return.

"What an odd assortment" Charles remarked.
The shadow that had been looming over him sighed, and Charles suddenly remembered the Orc's presence.

The sorcerer yelled and waved, "Hofskaar! We're leaving now!"

The Orc turned to rejoin the group as the filed out the door into the rainy street, but stopped as he saw another large figure drinking alone at a table in the middle of the room.
He timidly shuffled over to the table, and Charles

The voice from the heavens, that only Alakain could hear, boomed once again
"Roll for spot check"
Alakain paused before responding "One?"
"A natural one??"
"Yeah. It landed on 1."
"Okay, um, good."

Alakain smiled, beyond 100% positive that absolutely nothing was in the area around her.
Alakain's back erupted in pain as she was attacked by something in the area around her.

She cried out wildly, awaking all but DALLAS

The Stone Dragon slithered the words through a mouth of stone, with only a flicker of movement

"We come at night without being fetched...
...we disappear by day without being stol-"

"Stars."

The dragon's eyes widened in surprise at the voice that had suddenly cut in.

Everyone in the party turned to look at Hofskarr.
"Stars?" he said again, questioningly. "They come out at night and go away in the morning... Stars."
Silence.
"I like riddles, okay?"

The dragon was speechless.
"Uh... well- uh- yeah. That's. Um. You said that in the common tongue? Well... Sure. Go on I guess"

The solid stone along the east wall slid open to reveal a dark passageway.
The group collectively shrugged, and silently began to file in, one by one. Hofskarr brought up the rear as usual, stealing one last look at the dragon's dismayed expression before disappearing into the cool passage.
