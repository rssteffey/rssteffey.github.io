What's that, ardent follower? This post date says October something or other and it is in all actuality late November?

Well... you might be right.

I have several posts backlogged. Written, but unposted until now. Somehow this semester has proven itself more than capable of stressing me to extremes.
Anyways, I will be posting these posts with the date appropriate for the time they were actually written, not actually posted.

The following post was written on October 29th. (And illustrated in the time since)

I've spent the last few weeks describing this month as "juggling eggs".
It was only today when I looked up the phrase that I realized it is not ~~in fact~~ an actual idiom.

I'm relatively sure I just concatenated portions of other similar idioms together.

**Too many counted eggs in one basket before they've hatched in the fire** (calvacade of idioms)

Regardless, I feel like I am juggling eggs. Well, about a dozen real eggs, with a handful of plastic Easter Eggs thrown into the mix. The real eggs (Homework, video editing, grad school) are very much breakable. The plastic ones (Painting, Blog posts, Writing a Python script to make my fridge tweet magnetic letters...) are very much not, and could be dropped and picked up again later no problem.
Logically, I should just finish the routine with the current breakable eggs, and then enjoy the others.

Except that the plastic ones are fantastic. I do not hesitate to add the first neon pink Easter-egg that suddenly catches my eye to the ever-increasing queue of falling ova.

**Boston falling ovah**

Today's plastic egg: Turning Echo into Zero.
