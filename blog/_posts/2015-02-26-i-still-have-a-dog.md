description: In which Shawn deals with his choice to adopt a living caffeine molecule

I'm afraid I made a mistake in a prior post. I wrote an entire page about adopting Echo, but I kept referring to him as a dog.

It has been brought to my attention since this posting, that Echo is - in fact - a rare form of mountain goat.

This revelation shouldn't have come as a surprise, as the warning signs have been steadily progressing as he's grown comfortable in my house..

We've been told he may also be at least a tiny bit Gazelle, which makes sense given his propensity to leap over literally anything between him and his ball.
An actual summary of his genetics would read like the never-ending ingredients list for an artificial sweetener.

39% Mountain Goat (Climbing)
27% Gazelle (Leaping)
12% Anteater (Tongue Length)
9% Vulture (Desire to look down from a perch)
4% Gollum (In pooping posture only)
...
...
...
&lt;.025% Possessed Girl from "The Exorcist" (Sleep-twitching with eyes half open)
and trace amounts of dog.

But ultimately - he is 100% wallowing puddle of purposeful ignorance and subsequent guilt:

But in the end, he's still the best.
Goofy he may be, but I keep pausing while typing this post just to look over at him sleeping soundly in his bed in the corner of my room.

I can't help but be appreciative of the happiness he brings me.

The amount of loyalty and support he brings.

The way his tai-
...hold that thought.
